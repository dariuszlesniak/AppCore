AppCore
===================

AppCore is a layer built on top of [ResearchKit](https://github.com/researchkit/ResearchKit) which forms the core of
the five initial ResearchKit apps.

It includes some of the key features of those initial ResearchKit apps,
including:

* Dashboard with progress graphs
* Data storage back end
* JSON serialization and deserialization
* Integration with Sage Bionetworks' Bridge service

We are excited about how helpful AppCore has been in the development of several ResearchKit apps. In order to help the ResearchKit community derive the most utility from the individual components in AppCore, we’re working hard with many developers to transition components of AppCore into the main ResearchKit repo. As a result, we will only be accepting bug fixes to AppCore moving forward and hope you’ll continue giving feature and UI enhancements once the pieces are fully integrated into ResearchKit’s repo.

Building AppCore
----------------

AppCore does not build stand-alone, but rather is built as part of other
projects. To build it, go to one of the projects that uses it, such as
[Share the Journey](https://github.com/ResearchKit/ShareTheJourney).

OpenSSL
-------

This version of AppCore differs from the version in the shipping apps
because it does not include OpenSSL, which is used in the shipping apps
for Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) encryption support.

CMS is used by the apps in order to protect sensitive data stored
temporarily on the phone, and while in transit. It helps reduce
requirements on back-ends, so that HTTPS endpoints can safely be
terminated earlier than the final hop, because data encryption and
decryption occurs at the application layer.

To re-enable OpenSSL, build OpenSSL as an iOS static library, add it
to the AppCore library target, and then switch the CMS code to use
OpenSSL by removing `APCCMS_NoEncryption_JustAStub.m` from the target
and adding `APCCMS_UsingOpenSSL.m` instead.
